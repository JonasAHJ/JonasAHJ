- 👋 Hi, I’m @JonasAHJ, Jonas Joensen
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer- & Software Engineering and Networks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Engineering at Aalborg University, Denmark, Aalborg. The program is a combination of CompSCI and EE. 
- 💞️ Currently, I have no collaborations in mind. However, I have experience working with external partners. One of my first year university projects was to construct an 
application for a third party ISP, so I have experience collaborating and working with others. 
- 📫 I can be reached on either my private email jonasAHJ@gmail.com or my school mail jjoe21@student.aau.dk
